# Skills Icons Builder

A user-friendly URL builder for [Skills Icons](https://github.com/syvixor/skills-icons).

## How it Works

The application presents you with a list of available skill icons. As you select or deselect icons, the application dynamically constructs the corresponding API URL in real-time. You can then simply copy this generated URL and use it wherever you need to display your chosen skill icons.
